    "answer": "The pension and family pension under Employees’ Pension Scheme, 1995 are the Social Security benefits. It is viewed as a need based benefit. It is not related to the quantum of contribution paid by a member. A pensioner after attaining the age of 58 years is to take care of his spouse and in his absence the liability is restricted to one person. Hence 50% of the pension is payable. Whereas in the case of a member (non-pensioner) who dies leaving behind his spouse, children who are yet to complete their education, marriage etc. and also considering the pre-mature death of a member the quantum of pension payable to non-pensioner’s widow is on the higher side."
